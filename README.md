# Create Reflektor App

This tool can be used to generate project repository based on one of Reflektor's boilerplates.

### Usage

1. Ensure that you have an `.env` file with your GitHub account's personal token. Check `.env.example`.

> Since our boilerplates are currently private, we need this token to have access to the boilerplate repositories.

2. `yarn test`
